    Create a Fibonacci-style sequence up to the nth entry, based on an initial
    two-value sequeunce, where

    x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n-2}

    Parameter
    ---------
    n: int
        The entry up to which to generate the sequence (n > 0, i.e., n=1 is the
        first entry, etc). Defaults to 2, the length of the initial sequence.
    initialSequence: list
        A list containing the first two values of the sequence, defaulting to
        [0, 1].

    Returns
    -------
    sequence: list
        A list containing the full sequence.
